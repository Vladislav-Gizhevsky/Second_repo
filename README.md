# My second repository on Github


This repo made on github but everithing is pushed from VSCode. Nothing important, just learning a git capabilities with Windows.


File named "math_functions.py" have 4 main math operations [+, -, *, /], that you can use by importing the module and using the functions.


Thanks for opening the file and reading!
